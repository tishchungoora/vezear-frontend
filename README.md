# Vezear

Vezear is an open-source web application developed by Tish Chungoora & Jeremy Amram. The app was built in a one-week timeframe and is aimed at users who are starting up their business and need to quickly understand the software products and services they need to consider in order to run their business.

As such, the intention of Vezear is to act as a virtual advisor for products and services, serving recommendations to users of the application. Central to Vezear is the ability to collect basic user details and the completion of a short questionnaire. The application also provides a library of products and services that can be browsed on-demand.

## Motivation

- We wanted to build a web app that addresses an existing challenge faced by new business owners, reducing the time it takes for people to research about products and services during the start-up process.
- In order to utilise a full tech stack to develop Vezear, we built the application as a React-based web app with a Rails backend to showcase the use of React components, routes and states alongside Rails API.

## Main Features

- Form for capturing user details
- Guided questions as part of a questionnaire
- Library of products and services with keyword search and filtering capability
- Product show page featuring specific product details

## Stack

- Rails, Ruby, Active Record and Postgres for the [backend](https://github.com/tishchungoora/vezear-backend)
- React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and Bootstrap for the [frontend](https://github.com/tishchungoora/vezear-frontend)
